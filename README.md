For deploying a static webapp using Azure Static web app service we have to make a resource group in my case it was "Restaurant Website" and connect to github account in order to access repositories. Azure creates a github actions .yaml file in ".github/Workflows/ " which automatically detects a new commit and run a github actions workflow and the changes reflects on the actual website.
